# Project 1 Generative Text

Will Stock, wstock@ucsd.edu

## Abstract

For my project idea, I want to train a text generator with JSON file data of product reviews found at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. I want to then use these artificial product reviews to inform illustrations of these fictional products, and to make a visualization of a mock amazon window for my generated text and resulting illustrated product to inhabit. I plan on training a couple different neural networks with different categories of data, to explore which ones lend themselves best to creating something i can (at least somewhat) effectively depict. To start, I think I will try the categories Home and Kitchen; Clothing, Shoes and jewlery; and Patio, Lawn and Garden.

Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
- Repositories
- Blog posts
